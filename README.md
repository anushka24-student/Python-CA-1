Grocery Store Billing System

Problem Statement=>

A grocery store wants to calculate the total cost of items purchased by a customer.
The program should:
1)Accept prices of 3 items from the user.
2)Calculate the total cost.
3)Apply a 10% discount if the total exceeds $50.
4)Display the Original Total, Discount, and Final Payable Amount.

Approach=>

1)Take input for the prices of three items using input() and convert them to float.
2)Calculate the total cost by adding all three prices.
3)Check if the total cost is greater than 50:
  If yes, calculate a 10% discount.
  Otherwise, discount remains 0.
4)Subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount.
5)Display the results formatted to two decimal places.

Sample Output=>
Enter the price of item1: 30
Enter the price of item2: 23
Enter the price of item3: 90

Original Total: $ 143.00
Discount Total: $ 14.30
Final Amount: $ 128.70
